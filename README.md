Comprehensive BEAST Archive Network
-----------------------------------

This repository is intended to house [BEAST 2](http://www.beast2.org) package binaries developed by members of the University of Auckland's [Computational Evolution Group](http://compevol.auckland.ac.nz/).

Note that these packages are available from within BEAUti by selecting File->Manage Packages from the menu.  This repository is therefore really only of interest to those responsible for developing these packages.
